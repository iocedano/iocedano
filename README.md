### Hi folks 👋,

I'm Ismael Cedano, a Software Engineer who is interested in software architecture, monorepo, microservices, A11y, CWV and Full-Stack technology. I encourage others to share their knowledge, ask questions, make mistakes and understand that not only code to make tickets but also to maintain good practice and the quality of the code.

I have learned to Software Engineer thanks to college, Udacity, technology documentation, FrontEndMaster, Youtube and the latest but not least important; my co-workers.

#### 🔭 I’m currently working on

In the [CWV](https://web.dev/vitals/) initiative, which has the purpose of improving the website following the indicators established by Google, by implementing [web-vitals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals)  in a React webapp, we will be able to present our [RUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring) of each route, collecting the Chrome UX Report data, creating tests  and help other teams to implement their own tests

Before, I participated in the re-platform of a Real Estate platform from PHP to (React + Nodejs) using [kyt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kyt) and GraphQL; defining the architecture, modules, reusable components, pipelines and tests and more (the hard work of migrating from a legacy app 😅). The great thing about this experience is that I learned more about GraphQL, pipeline with Drone, Cloud Functions, testing, and my little passion to understand more about DevOps thanks to GCP.

##### Sides projects: 

- [Vacunaterd](https://vacunate.gob.do/): which is a platform that helps the government to digitally vaccination process; by developing the architecture, infra, pipelines, environment, and leading the team, we developed and maintain an app that helps to register de vaccinated and symptoms of the doses. We help more than 300+ Vaccination Centers per day.

- [eHospital](https://ehospital.do/) which is a startup in Telemedicine. This will change the ways in which people with limited resources can receive medical attention from specialists in different rural areas of the country.
