# Typescripts

#### Course: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/typescript-v3/introduction/
#### Docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html

What's TS?
(Simple way) It's a Javascript's typification language ðŸ˜… (please, It's not that simple)

```
This means that your existing working JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. 
The main benefit of TypeScript is that it can highlight unexpected behavior in your code, lowering the chance of bugs.
```

* It has the potential to move some kinds of errors from runtime to compile time ðŸ’Œ (TYPE CHECKING constanly; that's other way to prevent regression)

So far!
TS is not a vacine!

### Coding:

[tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)
[Options details](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig)


#### Notes:
Using `any` as a type declaration a doable case is when the data source is unknown! (saw some projects that use it a lot).

Be as explicit as you can (defining interfaces, functions, anything...)!! (we code for human not to  machine).

TS is not a vaccine!

### ToDo

* [ ] Migrate to JS https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-project-on-todo-list/

### Quations

* How do we migrate projects to TS?
`tsconfig.json` allows to segregate into small pieces of code (split and conquer ðŸŽ–)
